# Opencv-Video-to-Frames
Saving frames from video using Opencv for Python
# saveFrame function
Gets 2 inputs, start second and end second. So we can define which intervl of video we want to extract
# fps
We can also define how many frames we need to save per second (fps = 1 means 1 frame per second, fps = 0,5 means 2 frames per second)
# frame_name_count
in our function we save the file as frame + frame_name_count, so we need to increment it after every extraction
